Q4
Load data and package
# load dplyr
library("dplyr")

# load information about students and teachers
student = read.csv("student.csv")
teacher = read.csv("teacher.csv")
Filter Rows
# Filter individual row
filter(student, teacherID == "T1" & year2score < 80) 

# Filter groups
student %>% group_by(teacherID) %>% filter(mean(year1score) > 65)
Select columns
# Select columns
select(student, studentID, birthDay)

# Exclude columns
select(student, -studentID, -birthDay)
Sort rows
# Small to large
arrange(student, year1score)

# Large to small
arrange(student, desc(year1score))
Group rows
# Grouping
student %>% group_by(teacherID) 

# Ungrouping
student %>% ungroup()
Summarise by group
student %>% group_by(teacherID) %>% 
  summarise(mean_score1 = mean(year1score),
            mean_score2 = mean(year2score))
Add or edit column
# Add new column
student %>%  
  mutate(mean_score = (year1score + year2score)/2)
  
# Edit existing column
student %>%  
  mutate(year1score = scale(year1score))
Identify Unique rows
# unique values of all columns
student %>% distinct()

# unique values of teacherID
student %>% distinct(teacherID)
Sample Rows
# sample 10 rows
sample_n(student, 10)

# sample 30% of the rows
sample_frac(student, 0.3)
